==============================

Copyright (C) 2013 *[Oleksii Serdiuk](http://oleksii.name/)*.

**The Advanced Online Translator** uses available online translation
services to provide translations. Currently it supports only **Google
Translate** but more services are in the plans (i.e., **Bing
Translator**, **Yandex Translate**, etc.).

For **Google Translate** alternative and reverse translations are
displayed for single words.
